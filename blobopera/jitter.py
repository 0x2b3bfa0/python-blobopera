"""Audio jitter templates.

This module defines the protocol buffer format used for the default set of
jitter templates used by the audio engine. The :py:class:`Jitter` class can

    Given a list of templates where each template holds a list of float
    values, this algorithm will perform the following steps:

    1. Loop endlessly over randomly chosen templates, allowing the inner
       code to access both the current template and the previous template.

    2. Overlap each of these template pairs by the specified number of
       positions and perform a weighted mix of the overlapping values:

       .. code-block::

           1 2 3 · · · ·
           · · 4 5 6 · ·
           · · · · 7 8 9
           - - - - - - -
           1 2 * 5 * 8 9

       The mixing algorithm creates a smooth transition between the old
       and new templates by cross-fading the overlapping values.

    Yields:
        float: Jitter values.
