"""Corpus of libretto texts.

This module defines the protocol buffer format used for the default corpus of
libretto texts that is being used on interactive user-driven recordings. The
:py:class:`Corpus` class can be used to serialize and deserialize the
``recordedlibrettos.proto`` file from the original Blob Opera application.

Note:
    Texts on that file seem to come from Giuseppe Verdi's Otello, and serve as
    a good reference for translating Italian lyrics to phonemes with the
    :py:class:`Phoneme` syntax.
